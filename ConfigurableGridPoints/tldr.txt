- use new sharetrack API
- make {thing} happen when grid that contains {block subtype}
- i.e. make the points turn red in shift + T when over limit
- probably should port the new CGP grid point features over to SC sharetrack
- fork the slimmed down ish CGPGridPoints

- can make into base mod + addon later for public-facing release
